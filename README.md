# Scene-Recognition
Tiny image and bag-of-word visual vocabulary

The scene classification dataset consists of 15 scene categories including office, kitchen, and forest.
This system will compute a set of image representations (tiny image and bag-of-word visual vocabulary) and predict the category of each testing image using the classifiers (k-nearest neighbor and SVM) built on the training data

You can download the training and testing data from here:
